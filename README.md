# üì¢ Deprecation Notice
This examples repository has been deprecated and is maintained only for reference. Please visit the [examples-hub](https://github.com/getpara/examples-hub) repository for the most current Para examples and implementations.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
We are currently migrating to our new name Para at the github.com/getpara organization. A new examples hub is available with improved examples at https://github.com/getpara/new-examples-hub/. During this transition period, you can reference both example repositories:
- The examples-hub (this repo) uses the legacy @usecapsule/* dependencies
- The new-examples-hub uses the updated @getpara/* dependencies

# Examples Hub

A centralized repository featuring comprehensive Capsule SDK examples. For more details, visit the
